# Max snow depth on this legacy airport
#
# For example:
# - XP11 legacy airport with X-Plane ground polys (e.g. Taimodels ENGM): 0.07
# - Airport converted from p3d where ground is built from .obj files (e.g. Aerosoft EDDB although claimed as XP12 compatible): 0.011
#
# Note that everything <= 0.01 is effectively 0
